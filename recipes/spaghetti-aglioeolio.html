<p>No two aglio e oglio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.</p>
<p>The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil.</p>
<p>if it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</p>
        <p>Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
        <p>Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</p>
    <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
        <p>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</p>
        <p>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.</p>
        <p>Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
    <li><b>Step 3</b></li>
        <p>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</p>
        <p>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</p>
    <li><b>Step 4</b></li>
        <p>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
    <li><b>Step 5</b></li>
        <p>Enjoy your meal.</p>
